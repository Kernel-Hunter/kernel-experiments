# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! A few ground rules:

- Always test kernel-related changes on a VM.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- For kernel code, include rationale and testing steps in PR description.
- For Python and shell scripts, include linting and docs.

To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a topic branch (feature/whatever).
3. Run linters locally (flake8 for Python, shellcheck for shell).
4. Open a pull request against main with clear description of changes.
